## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** NodeJS, express, mysql, ejs

This app is build using node.js and express for the server, EJS for the template engine and lastlty there 3 types of database I use. The first one is using fileSystem and a normal json file, second is using mysql and sequelize.

## Optimizations

- DRY code
- naming convention

## Lessons Learned:

- Basics of NodeJS
- Use of NodeJS core modules (fs, path)
- express
- template engine (EJS)
- MVC
